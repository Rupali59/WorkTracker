### Development Summary

**🔧 Projects Worked On:**

#### **Rupali59 - GitHub Profile Automation**
Daily automated metrics collection and profile maintenance.

#### **VipinKaushik - Production Readiness Sprint: Error Handling, Asset Management & CI/CD**
Major sprint focused on error handling infrastructure, asset organization, documentation, and deployment pipeline stabilization.

**Technical Work:**

**1. Error Handling & Reporting System**
- **Comprehensive Error Pages**: Built custom 404, 500, and general error pages with user-friendly messaging, troubleshooting steps, and navigation recovery options
- **GitHub Issue Integration**: Implemented automated error reporting system where users can submit bug reports directly from error pages, auto-populating GitHub issues with error context
- **In-Page Error Form**: Created client-side error reporting form with validation, rate limiting, and GitHub API integration for seamless issue creation
- **Enhanced Error Diagnostics**: Captured comprehensive HTTP request details (headers, status codes, request/response bodies, timestamps) for better debugging
- **Error Content i18n**: Moved error page content to separate translation files for multi-language support and easier content management
- **GitHub Issue Templates**: Added structured issue templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`) for bugs, features, and documentation requests with proper YAML front matter
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides for GitHub issue integration, error reporting workflows, and troubleshooting procedures

**2. Asset Management & Image System**
- **Public Folder Restructuring**: Reorganized `/public` directory with semantic folder structure (images/mentors, images/services, images/logos, icons/, fonts/) for better asset discoverability
- **Placeholder Image System**: Generated 55 optimized placeholder images covering all site sections (mentors, services, testimonials, blog posts, backgrounds) for complete visual coverage during development
- **Image Path Updates**: Refactored all image imports across components to match new folder structure, preventing broken image references
- **Mentor Avatar System**: Updated mentor profile components to use initials-based avatars as fallback instead of emojis, improving professional appearance
- **Image Format Consistency**: Standardized mentor images to use `.jpg` extension with proper compression and sizing
- **SVG Icon System**: Reverted to SVG icons for better scalability and performance, extracting reusable icons to shared icon library
- **Image Documentation**: Created comprehensive image requirements documentation specifying dimensions, formats, compression ratios, and naming conventions

**3. Documentation & Developer Experience**
- **Content Structure Guide**: Added detailed documentation explaining project content organization, file naming conventions, and MDX frontmatter schemas
- **Credentials System**: Set up credentials folder with environment variable templates, `.env.example` files, and secure configuration guidelines
- **Docs Folder Activation**: Enabled and structured `/docs` directory with onboarding guides, architecture decisions, and contribution guidelines
- **Build Configuration Docs**: Documented Next.js configuration, lockfile management, and common build warnings/fixes

**4. Project Cleanup & Maintenance**
- **Folder Renaming**: Renamed `wisdom` directory to `blogs` for clearer naming convention, updated all references
- **Build Log Removal**: Cleaned up accidentally committed build artifacts and log files
- **Dead Code Elimination**: Removed unused components, deprecated utilities, and commented-out code
- **Next.js Config Cleanup**: Simplified `next.config.js` removing unnecessary options, documented lockfile warning resolution

**5. CI/CD & Build Pipeline Fixes**
- **ESLint Circular Dependency**: Resolved circular import issue causing ESLint crashes by restructuring component dependencies and exports
- **ESLint CI Configuration**: Fixed ESLint configuration for GitHub Actions, ensuring consistent linting in CI environment vs local development
- **Build Error Resolution**: Debugged and fixed TypeScript compilation errors, missing dependencies, and Next.js build warnings
- **CI Workflow Updates**: Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow with better caching, parallel job execution, and failure notifications
- **Vercel Deployment Control**: Disabled automatic deployments on feature branches in Vercel configuration to prevent quota exhaustion

**6. Navigation & UI Improvements**
- **Major Navigation Refactor**: Enhanced navigation system with improved dropdown menus, better mobile responsiveness, and smoother animations
- **UI Polish**: Applied consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes across navigation components
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Added proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility

**7. Feature Branch Integration**
- Merged two `booking` feature branches (#9, #10) containing scheduling system enhancements and calendar integration
- Conducted thorough regression testing across error handling and asset management changes
- Maintained stable main branch while iterating on production readiness features

**Technologies**: Next.js error boundaries, GitHub REST API, GitHub issue templates, YAML, image optimization (sharp/next-image), SVG, ESLint, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Vercel deployment, i18n error handling, TypeScript strict mode, asset pipeline management
