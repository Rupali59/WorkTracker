### 📝 **Obsidian Vault** (8 commits)

**Calendar System Improvements:**
- **Calendar Formatting Fix**: Resolved inconsistent markdown link formatting in August 2025 monthly overview, ensuring all dates properly link to their daily note files
- **Missing Date Indicators**: Updated monthly calendar views to display `✖️` for dates without corresponding daily notes instead of broken links, improving UX across all monthly overviews
- **Human-Readable Commit Formatting**: Implemented automated conversion of raw commit messages to technical summaries for May through September 2025 calendar entries

**Data Collection System Enhancements:**
- **Script Directory Refactoring**: Reorganized Scripts directory structure with proper separation of concerns - moved all logs to `logs/`, configs to `config/`, and collectors to `data_collectors/` for better maintainability
- **Commit Details Integration**: Enhanced unified data collector to capture and display detailed commit information (SHA, message, author, URL) instead of just counts
- **Technical Summaries**: Added comprehensive technical summaries to all October calendar entries, converting raw commit data into human-readable development narratives
- **Bug Fixes**: Resolved indentation errors in the data collector script and ensured proper data aggregation across multiple repositories

**Technical Impact:**

  - Updated CI dependencies group with 3 package updates
  - Bumped production dependencies group with 6 updates, keeping the project current with latest stable versions
