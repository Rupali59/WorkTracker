## 📊 Daily Overview

Split time between documenting new calendar narratives inside the Obsidian vault and keeping the WorkTracker Quartz deployment healthy (dependencies, redirects, sync automation) so the public site stays perfectly aligned with the vault.

## 🚀 GitHub Activity

### Development Summary

**🔧 Projects Worked On:**

#### **1. Obsidian Vault**
*Knowledge Management System*

- **Commits**: 1
- **Focus**: Calendar Publishing & Narrative Quality

**Work Details:**
- Added technical writeups for November 13–14 entries so exported notes carry full context
- Synced analytics tables alongside the narratives to keep historical dashboards accurate
- Ensured downstream Quartz automations can mirror the refreshed markdown without manual edits

**📝 Commit Summary:**
- Published November 13–14 calendar entries with human-readable technical summaries and updated analytics tables so the public site mirrors the vault narratives

#### **2. WorkTracker**
*Quartz Static Site backed by the vault*

- **Commits**: 9
- **Pull Requests**: 1
- **Issues**: 1
- **Focus**: Dependency Health, Content Sync Automation, Quartz Upstream Merge

**Work Details:**
- **Dependency & Preview Reliability**: Refreshed production dependency set, added `index.md` homepage, and implemented redirect logic so local previews use the same `baseDir` as production
- **Calendar Synchronization**: Synced new Obsidian entries, removed deleted files, and switched to filesystem timestamps so Git only tracks meaningful changes
- **Quartz Upstream Alignment**: Temporarily replaced symlinks with real files to avoid merge conflicts, then pulled the latest Quartz changes while preserving custom cards and styling

**📝 Commit Summaries:**
- Updated production dependencies to remove security noise and keep Quartz on supported versions
- Added an `index.md` homepage and improved default routing for the WorkTracker site
- Implemented redirects from the root path to `baseDir` so local previews behave like production
- Pulled new calendar content from Obsidian into WorkTracker to keep the public view current
- Merged upstream Quartz changes while preserving custom components and styling
- Temporarily replaced symlinks with real files to unblock the upstream merge process
- Switched date priority to filesystem timestamps to prevent noisy Git diffs during sync
- Synced newly written calendar Markdown from Obsidian into the WorkTracker repo
- Removed deleted calendar files so Quartz doesn’t render stale or orphaned pages

### Technical Insights

**🔍 Work Patterns:**
- ~90% of the effort targeted Quartz automation and infrastructure, with the rest invested in vault documentation
- Automation changes ensure WorkTracker mirrors Obsidian within the same day

**🛠️ Highlights:**
- Dependency refresh + redirect fixes keep local previews identical to production
- Filesystem-first timestamping removes accidental Git diffs during automated syncs
- Quartz and Obsidian now share identical narrative + analytics data, eliminating drift
