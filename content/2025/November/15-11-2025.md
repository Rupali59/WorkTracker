### Development Summary

**🔧 Projects Worked On:**

#### **1. WebsiteCompanion**
*Companion dashboard + workflow tooling for Website CRM*

- **Commits**: 4
- **Focus**: Project bootstrap, deployment hygiene, secret handling

**Work Details:**
- Stood up an initial **Next.js** dashboard layout (shell, navigation, base components) for Website CRM operations
- Created a **Vercel** deployment workflow so pushes to the main branch automatically build and deploy the dashboard
- Locked down configuration by removing hard-coded **environment secrets** from the codebase and adding `.env` files to `.gitignore`
- Documented that all production secrets must flow through **Vercel project settings** or a secret manager, not local config files

#### **2. VipinKaushik**
*Personal Astrology Platform (Next.js + Astro)*

- **Commits**: 29
- **Pull Requests**: 3
- **Issues**: 3
- **Focus**: CI/CD reliability, Panchang service stability, authentication + UI polish

**Work Details:**
- **Pipelines & Deploy Automation:** Tightened **GitHub Actions** workflows to require env vars, removed **TypeScript** build noise, and wired up automatic deploys via **Vercel GitHub integration** with stable preview URLs and branch-protection-aware checks
- **Testing & Diagnostics:** Stabilized the test suite (fixing flaky page imports), added a dedicated **astrology API test endpoint**, improved structured error logging, and configured serverless function **region (bom1/Mumbai)** for lower latency
- **Panchang Engine:** Added retry-safe **MongoDB/Mongoose** conflict handling, hardened Panchang API error responses, and improved the Panchang badge + CTA so users can quickly jump to “View Panchang” without confusion
- **Product Features:** Delivered a full **authentication** flow (login, session handling), Panchang domain APIs and database models, and integrated them into the **Next.js** UI; merged the `login` feature work via multiple PRs to close onboarding issues
